## M-Task
***
I have made this react project for Task Management. This is a task management site for the company "Task Mangement Inc". Of course, it's dynamic. A visitor can:
* See his tasks that he added 
* The tasks are divided in
* After seeing the details, a user can request for that meal
* Visitors can also like and comment in any meal from both showings and upcomings 
* They can see the meals they requested for
* They can search the meals they wanted for
* They can buy and hold any of the silver, gold and platinum packages
* It is responsive, so he can use and see updates from mobile
* So, find, search & request meals according to their demands

## The Server
* The site receives data from a live server using MongoDB Database
* The vercel server generates all the data dynamically to the site

## Packages & Technologies
* vite-react
* node js
* firebase
* express
* mongoDB
* axios
* vercel
* react-hook-form etc.

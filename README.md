## M-Task
***
I have made this react project for Task Management. This is a task management site for the company "Task Mangement Inc". Of course, it's dynamic. A visitor can:
* See his tasks that he added 
* The tasks are divided in


## The Server
* The site receives data from a live server using MongoDB Database
* The vercel server generates all the data dynamically to the site

## Packages & Technologies
* vite-react
* node js
* firebase
* express
* mongoDB
* axios
* vercel
* react-hook-form etc.

Here's the live site Link: https://scc-tech.web.app/
